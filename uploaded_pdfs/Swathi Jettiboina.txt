OBJECTIVE 
With a strong foundation in Java, full-stack development, and computer fundamentals, I have 
expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and image processing. I have built projects like a CNN-based 
signature forgery detection system and a full-stack blog application. Actively contributing to the tech 
community, I have organized events, volunteered, and participated in hackathons like Flipkart GRiD 5.0. I 
strive to innovate and develop impactful solutions in a dynamic environment.
