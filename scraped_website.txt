JMAN partners with our clients to track company performance and quantify value creation levers in an automated way from source systems. We provide a consolidated view of company performance to surface foundational insights and support decision-making. Our Core Reporting solution focuses on consolidating commercial, financial and operational data to gain an accurate view of historical and future business performance. Our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on monitoring the levers of EV by designing and building scalable data models to support current and future use cases. JMANâs approach enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creation. Data platform connects directly to company source systems enabling the automatic and seamless refresh of data. Use of Tableau/Power BI allows for highly tailored reports targeted at specific management and operational audiences. Management and operational access to tailored reports allows data-driven decision making across the business. Executives can clearly identify and quantify value levers to target. Managers and the operational teams then act on data, not instinct, to execute. Modular approach makes it easy to combine data from multiple entities across different industries and geographies. Approach allows source systems and analytical tools to be easily added (e.g., post M&A) and capacity expanded as the company grows. Data platform enables company to collect and store the large volumes of high quality, structured data required for the deployment of advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Automated data flows significantly reduce the finance functionâs workload. Time-consuming manual processes, with material risk of errors no longer required. The finance team can focus on higher-value activities and promote the data-driven value creation agenda. Our partnerships typically start as a specific use case, but as we build value for your company the relationship grows and expands. After we uncover value and gain board buy-in, we typically move on to designing a scalable data platform that can house the logic and insights in an ongoing and automated way. We place a lot of emphasis on ensuring that data resonates from the board through operational levels and that reports are being utilized by the business to drive commercial growth. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it. JMAN are neither too big not to care, nor too small not to have the required breadth of experience and expertise to speak to the spectrum of themes required in a replete data roadmap.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value. 

 We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

							At JMAN, our belief that extraordinary people are instrumental to our success means that we want to support anyone and everyone to reach their full potential â HOPE does just this in both our local Chennai community and beyond. Every year JMAN hosts an annual activity fundraiser, in Spring 2023, the JMAN team took on the challenge of walking, running, cycling and or swimming 12,000 miles, equating to the distance from JMAN London to JMAN Chennai and back to JMAN London to raise money to support their operations.â						 
								Ignite Hubsâ vision is to empower all children and young people with the mindset and skills to become whoever they want to live life on their terms.

								The Early Careers Foundation (ECF) is part of the Ladder Group â a group of two companies and one charity, working together to create incredible careers for everyone. The ECF works closely with corporate and school partners to help young people from low-income backgrounds access the resources they need to successfully move into the professional world. Their initiatives offer guidance, knowledge, experience, and financial support to help navigate this transition. 							 
							At JMAN, we believe in the Early Careers Foundation's mission for improving social mobility and their vision for a more inclusive and equitable future, proving that with the right support, everyone has the potential to succeed. Our team members have collectively dedicated more than 40 hours to supporting the foundationâs beneficiaries and we cannot wait to see the impact grow as we move through the programâs cycle and support the next wave of cohorts.						 
								Matchable is a corporate volunteering platform that leverages the specialized skills and knowledge of volunteers to address specific challenges faced by nonprofits in their communities across the world.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

JMAN partners with our clients to track company performance and quantify value creation levers in an automated way from source systems. We provide a consolidated view of company performance to surface foundational insights and support decision-making. Our Core Reporting solution focuses on consolidating commercial, financial and operational data to gain an accurate view of historical and future business performance. Our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on monitoring the levers of EV by designing and building scalable data models to support current and future use cases. JMANâs approach enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creation. Data platform connects directly to company source systems enabling the automatic and seamless refresh of data. Use of Tableau/Power BI allows for highly tailored reports targeted at specific management and operational audiences. Management and operational access to tailored reports allows data-driven decision making across the business. Executives can clearly identify and quantify value levers to target. Managers and the operational teams then act on data, not instinct, to execute. Modular approach makes it easy to combine data from multiple entities across different industries and geographies. Approach allows source systems and analytical tools to be easily added (e.g., post M&A) and capacity expanded as the company grows. Data platform enables company to collect and store the large volumes of high quality, structured data required for the deployment of advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Automated data flows significantly reduce the finance functionâs workload. Time-consuming manual processes, with material risk of errors no longer required. The finance team can focus on higher-value activities and promote the data-driven value creation agenda. Our partnerships typically start as a specific use case, but as we build value for your company the relationship grows and expands. After we uncover value and gain board buy-in, we typically move on to designing a scalable data platform that can house the logic and insights in an ongoing and automated way. We place a lot of emphasis on ensuring that data resonates from the board through operational levels and that reports are being utilized by the business to drive commercial growth. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value. 

 We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

							At JMAN, our belief that extraordinary people are instrumental to our success means that we want to support anyone and everyone to reach their full potential â HOPE does just this in both our local Chennai community and beyond. Every year JMAN hosts an annual activity fundraiser, in Spring 2023, the JMAN team took on the challenge of walking, running, cycling and or swimming 12,000 miles, equating to the distance from JMAN London to JMAN Chennai and back to JMAN London to raise money to support their operations.â						 
								Ignite Hubsâ vision is to empower all children and young people with the mindset and skills to become whoever they want to live life on their terms.

								The Early Careers Foundation (ECF) is part of the Ladder Group â a group of two companies and one charity, working together to create incredible careers for everyone. The ECF works closely with corporate and school partners to help young people from low-income backgrounds access the resources they need to successfully move into the professional world. Their initiatives offer guidance, knowledge, experience, and financial support to help navigate this transition. 							 
							At JMAN, we believe in the Early Careers Foundation's mission for improving social mobility and their vision for a more inclusive and equitable future, proving that with the right support, everyone has the potential to succeed. Our team members have collectively dedicated more than 40 hours to supporting the foundationâs beneficiaries and we cannot wait to see the impact grow as we move through the programâs cycle and support the next wave of cohorts.						 
								Matchable is a corporate volunteering platform that leverages the specialized skills and knowledge of volunteers to address specific challenges faced by nonprofits in their communities across the world.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

This will involve transferring your data outside the UK to our overseas offices in India and the USA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK law, we always ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that the following safeguards are implemented by requiring all our group companies to follow the same set of rules when processing your personal data. (as binding corporate rulesâ) or we use specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK, namely by putting in place an International Data Transfer Agreement or The International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commissionâs standard contractual clauses for international data transfers. We may also transfer your personal data to service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. This may involve transferring personal data outside the UK to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK law. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK to service providers, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that the following safeguards are in place: The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing in line with the transfer protections outlined above. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for a number of years after they cease being customers. In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. You have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissionerâs Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).

JMAN partners with our clients to track company performance and quantify value creation levers in an automated way from source systems. We provide a consolidated view of company performance to surface foundational insights and support decision-making. Our Core Reporting solution focuses on consolidating commercial, financial and operational data to gain an accurate view of historical and future business performance. Our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on monitoring the levers of EV by designing and building scalable data models to support current and future use cases. JMANâs approach enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creation. Data platform connects directly to company source systems enabling the automatic and seamless refresh of data. Use of Tableau/Power BI allows for highly tailored reports targeted at specific management and operational audiences. Management and operational access to tailored reports allows data-driven decision making across the business. Executives can clearly identify and quantify value levers to target. Managers and the operational teams then act on data, not instinct, to execute. Modular approach makes it easy to combine data from multiple entities across different industries and geographies. Approach allows source systems and analytical tools to be easily added (e.g., post M&A) and capacity expanded as the company grows. Data platform enables company to collect and store the large volumes of high quality, structured data required for the deployment of advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Automated data flows significantly reduce the finance functionâs workload. Time-consuming manual processes, with material risk of errors no longer required. The finance team can focus on higher-value activities and promote the data-driven value creation agenda. Our partnerships typically start as a specific use case, but as we build value for your company the relationship grows and expands. After we uncover value and gain board buy-in, we typically move on to designing a scalable data platform that can house the logic and insights in an ongoing and automated way. We place a lot of emphasis on ensuring that data resonates from the board through operational levels and that reports are being utilized by the business to drive commercial growth. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it. JMAN are neither too big not to care, nor too small not to have the required breadth of experience and expertise to speak to the spectrum of themes required in a replete data roadmap.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value. 

 We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

We take pride in our work. This is our company. We share our diversity and learn from each other. Our range of perspectives makes us stronger. We have different interests and share curiosity. We're not afraid to do things differently. We are united by our values. We take risks; we back ourselves. We step outside of our comfort zone. We trust ourselves and each other. We aren't afraid to fail, it's how we learn. A win is a win, no matter how big or small. We recognize and share our progress: it motivates us to push on. The ups and downs drive us forward. When we win, we win together. We think big and dream bigger. We're about development, not just performance. We don't have a finish line. We are thinking about what comes next. We're changing and growing - always. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

Every year JMAN hosts an annual activity fundraiser, in Spring 2023, the JMAN team took on the challenge of walking, running, cycling and or swimming 12,000 miles, equating to the distance from JMAN London to JMAN Chennai and back to JMAN London to raise money to support their operations.â						 
								Ignite Hubsâ vision is to empower all children and young people with the mindset and skills to become whoever they want to live life on their terms.

								The Early Careers Foundation (ECF) is part of the Ladder Group â a group of two companies and one charity, working together to create incredible careers for everyone. The ECF works closely with corporate and school partners to help young people from low-income backgrounds access the resources they need to successfully move into the professional world. Their initiatives offer guidance, knowledge, experience, and financial support to help navigate this transition.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK law, we always ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that the following safeguards are implemented by requiring all our group companies to follow the same set of rules when processing your personal data. (as binding corporate rulesâ) or we use specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK, namely by putting in place an International Data Transfer Agreement or The International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commissionâs standard contractual clauses for international data transfers. We may also transfer your personal data to service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. This may involve transferring personal data outside the UK to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK law.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for a number of years after they cease being customers.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissionerâs Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).

JMAN partners with our clients to track company performance and quantify value creation levers in an automated way from source systems. We provide a consolidated view of company performance to surface foundational insights and support decision-making. Our Core Reporting solution focuses on consolidating commercial, financial and operational data to gain an accurate view of historical and future business performance. Our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on monitoring the levers of EV by designing and building scalable data models to support current and future use cases. JMANâs approach enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creation. Data platform connects directly to company source systems enabling the automatic and seamless refresh of data. Use of Tableau/Power BI allows for highly tailored reports targeted at specific management and operational audiences. Management and operational access to tailored reports allows data-driven decision making across the business. Executives can clearly identify and quantify value levers to target. Managers and the operational teams then act on data, not instinct, to execute. Modular approach makes it easy to combine data from multiple entities across different industries and geographies. Approach allows source systems and analytical tools to be easily added (e.g., post M&A) and capacity expanded as the company grows. Data platform enables company to collect and store the large volumes of high quality, structured data required for the deployment of advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Automated data flows significantly reduce the finance functionâs workload. Time-consuming manual processes, with material risk of errors no longer required. The finance team can focus on higher-value activities and promote the data-driven value creation agenda. Our partnerships typically start as a specific use case, but as we build value for your company the relationship grows and expands. After we uncover value and gain board buy-in, we typically move on to designing a scalable data platform that can house the logic and insights in an ongoing and automated way. We place a lot of emphasis on ensuring that data resonates from the board through operational levels and that reports are being utilized by the business to drive commercial growth. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it. JMAN are neither too big not to care, nor too small not to have the required breadth of experience and expertise to speak to the spectrum of themes required in a replete data roadmap. Our unique depth of capability across strategy, analytics, data governance, data science and engineering as well as the private equity landscape and our flexible approach to resourcing means we are singularly well positioned to not only advise you on what you need, but to actually then deliver it, too.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value.

We partner with our clients to instill confidence throughout an investment transaction. We use supporting first- and third-party data to test commercial hypotheses, extracting detailed insight on a target and uncovering areas of opportunity. Additionally, we assess whether a targetâs underlying data asset can support delivery of your VCP, providing a suggested roadmap for implementation to realize value in the first 100 days up until exit and beyond. Our Due Diligence solution offers both data-led commercial due diligence and data diligence to support your investment hypotheses both before and during a transaction, surfacing insight within days on both historic commercial performance and the current data landscapeâ. JMANâs approach to delivering and supporting due diligence ensures more accurate valuations, offers clarity on post-acquisition roadmaps & ensures a seamless transition into value creation.
 Our diligence process is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We see the best results when we work with our partners to design an approach around their investment thesis, focusing on the most important questions to assess business health and feasibility of delivering the value creation plan. Moreover, our experience in delivering commercial tools in the value creation phase of the lifecycle means we are well poised to tie in our expertise to inform, and support on delivery of, a prioritized roadmap for the target, tailored to where you expect the most value.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy.

JMAN partners with our clients to track company performance and quantify value creation levers in an automated way from source systems. We provide a consolidated view of company performance to surface foundational insights and support decision-making. Our Core Reporting solution focuses on consolidating commercial, financial and operational data to gain an accurate view of historical and future business performance. Our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on monitoring the levers of EV by designing and building scalable data models to support current and future use cases. JMANâs approach enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creation. Data platform connects directly to company source systems enabling the automatic and seamless refresh of data. Use of Tableau/Power BI allows for highly tailored reports targeted at specific management and operational audiences. Management and operational access to tailored reports allows data-driven decision making across the business. Executives can clearly identify and quantify value levers to target. Managers and the operational teams then act on data, not instinct, to execute. Modular approach makes it easy to combine data from multiple entities across different industries and geographies. Approach allows source systems and analytical tools to be easily added (e.g., post M&A) and capacity expanded as the company grows. Data platform enables company to collect and store the large volumes of high quality, structured data required for the deployment of advanced analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Automated data flows significantly reduce the finance functionâs workload. Time-consuming manual processes, with material risk of errors no longer required. The finance team can focus on higher-value activities and promote the data-driven value creation agenda. Our partnerships typically start as a specific use case, but as we build value for your company the relationship grows and expands. After we uncover value and gain board buy-in, we typically move on to designing a scalable data platform that can house the logic and insights in an ongoing and automated way. We place a lot of emphasis on ensuring that data resonates from the board through operational levels and that reports are being utilized by the business to drive commercial growth. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

At JMAN, we empower our clients to understand and assess opportunities to drive top and bottom-line growth across a range of commercial levers (i.e., pricing, churn, lead generation). This imperative remains central to our Data Advisory & Digitalization solutions. We are experts in helping business leaders to walk the tight-rope of neither under-investing in foundational capabilities essential for staying ahead of the curve, nor expending critical capital, time and capacity for change on strategic programs that wonât deliver enough ROI via those commercial levers at the right pace.
 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it. JMAN are neither too big not to care, nor too small not to have the required breadth of experience and expertise to speak to the spectrum of themes required in a replete data roadmap. Our unique depth of capability across strategy, analytics, data governance, data science and engineering as well as the private equity landscape and our flexible approach to resourcing means we are singularly well positioned to not only advise you on what you need, but to actually then deliver it, too.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value. 

 We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

 As sources and volumes of data proliferate and the AI revolution accelerates change, the need for a clear actionable data strategy is markedly increasing â but finding the time to not only create one but generate alignment that is it the right one is increasingly difficult. Our approach focuses on providing our partners with clear, concise, actionable imperatives â plainly presented and done in minimal time.
 If you want to ensure your company is on the right path towards leveraging data to drive growth, capitalize on efficiencies, reduce risk and ultimately deliver on a digital-first positioning, JMAN can help you understand the route ahead, and then deliver on it. JMAN are neither too big not to care, nor too small not to have the required breadth of experience and expertise to speak to the spectrum of themes required in a replete data roadmap. Our unique depth of capability across strategy, analytics, data governance, data science and engineering as well as the private equity landscape and our flexible approach to resourcing means we are singularly well positioned to not only advise you on what you need, but to actually then deliver it, too. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

JMAN partners with our clients to identify and prioritize key commercial opportunities for accelerating growth and increasing profitability. We then develop and build Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GenAI execution tools to enable our clients to achieve commercial value. The tools we build are typically embedded into the company's source and sales systems creating a permanent asset for the business, ensuring we drive value in both the immediate and long term.

 As the expectation for value creation initiatives increases throughout the investment lifecycle, our partnerships with portfolio companies focus on accelerating your VCP. We have expertise across a range of value creation activities. JMAN builds Data and AI tools to accelerate business growth and improve profitability. Data and AI tools allow facts not âgut feelâ to drive decision making. Tools clearly and quickly surface insights and priority actions. Priority actions can then be automated, further enhancing efficiency (e.g., Churn tools can send tailored marketing to customers identified by AI model as at risk of not re-subscribing).â Advanced Analytics and ML/AI can surface information and insights that are not otherwise accessible. Fully leveraging the power of your company data is essential to maximizing potential and short- and long-term profitability.â The effective use of Data and AI is a key source of business competitive advantage. Companies that do not adopt Data and AI will be increasingly left behind by those that do. It’s better to be at the front of the curve than try to play catch-up.â Our teams bring a unique combination of commercial and technical expertise to every client engagement. This allows us to act with the speed and quality of a traditional consulting firm to identify commercial priorities, but also build and develop the execution tools using the latest data and technology approaches to deliver and institutionalize value. 

 We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.

We partner with our clients to instill confidence throughout an investment transaction. We use supporting first- and third-party data to test commercial hypotheses, extracting detailed insight on a target and uncovering areas of opportunity. Additionally, we assess whether a targetâs underlying data asset can support delivery of your VCP, providing a suggested roadmap for implementation to realize value in the first 100 days up until exit and beyond. Our Due Diligence solution offers both data-led commercial due diligence and data diligence to support your investment hypotheses both before and during a transaction, surfacing insight within days on both historic commercial performance and the current data landscapeâ. JMANâs approach to delivering and supporting due diligence ensures more accurate valuations, offers clarity on post-acquisition roadmaps & ensures a seamless transition into value creation.
 Our diligence process is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We see the best results when we work with our partners to design an approach around their investment thesis, focusing on the most important questions to assess business health and feasibility of delivering the value creation plan. Moreover, our experience in delivering commercial tools in the value creation phase of the lifecycle means we are well poised to tie in our expertise to inform, and support on delivery of, a prioritized roadmap for the target, tailored to where you expect the most value.

JMAN partners with our clients by using data to defend higher valuations, de-risk transactions and identify opportunities for further growth. We take messy data from different sources in your organization and turn it into clean, trusted data to communicate a strong equity story around your businessâs growth. Our approach typically leaves management with a lasting data asset and management information that is fully-integrated into the business â building something for the future, not just the transaction. This tech-enabled approach supports the data maturity journey of a business, laying the foundations for future scale with next investors and a data platform for successful M&A growth. As more granular data sets, tech-enabled data assets and a data-driven management team are increasingly expected at exit, our partnerships with funds and portfolio companies focus on demonstrating to bidders that de-risking the transaction has been undertaken, giving greater confidence to drive commercial value and provide a platform for future growth.â

 If you want your company to demonstrate that it is a progressive data and technology-orientated business, JMAN can help shape that narrative and provide a third-party perspective on your growth story. Access to data of unprecedented depth and breadth can be used by the “sell-side” to demonstrate the predictability and quality of revenue streams, organic versus inorganic growth rates and other themes central to a companyâs equity storyâ. Investors can use detailed data to get more confident in their investment theses and potentially pay more. What would previously have been qualitative statements from management can now be proven with data.â Best-in-class data platform ensures data quality is no longer a potential barrier to launching a transaction. A company can go to market quickly at any time.â Sell-side bankers can now focus on running the transaction instead of worrying about data preparation and quality.â Data cube provides clear single source of truth for all sell-side materials (e.g., IM, Forecast Model, Management Q&A responses)â. Data Platform is built directly into company source systems creating a long-term tool for management. This provides management with a permanent, highly scalable, best-in-class data platform and reporting suite to use to manage the businessâ. Best-in-class platform enables faster reporting, enhanced decision making, and builds foundations for advanced analytics and future value creationâ. Leveraging a dedicated JMAN team with the extensive data capabilities and private equity market expertise, can help ensure management can focus on presenting themselves as a mature business, being data-driven across initiative prioritization, strategic decision making, and day-to-day operational management. From a long-term perspective, JMAN seeks to deliver embedded data assets that are owned and managed by the business, which makes life easier both before, during, and after a transaction. With experience on both the buy and sell sides, plus private equity expertise and technological proficiency, JMAN is uniquely positioned to support management teams. In the past 12 months, weâve worked with over 100 PE-backed businesses across 50+ funds, providing deep insight into transaction dynamics and the effective use of data to defend higher valuations. Our technology enabled approach results in lasting data assets that stay with management after the transaction, uniquely leaving a business with a platform for growth, especially those pursuing a rapid buy-and-build strategy. We combine our data science and data engineering expertise with our deep commercial understanding to deliver tangible, high-value outcomes for PE funds and their portfolio companies.
